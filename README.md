# Vision Extension Examples
This is a collection of example Vision Extensions. They are meant to showcase the capabilities of Vision Extensions and provide a starting point for your own extensions.

## How do Vision Extension work?
Vision Extensions work similar to Twitch Extensions. They are web applications that are embedded into the Vision Overlay and provide optional settings to the Overlay Editor.

Vision provides a Storage API for layer and extension wide storage. This can be used to store settings or other data that should be persisted between overlays.

**Vision is currently in development and not yet available for public use, the API and capabilities of Vision Extensions will be expanded in the near future.**
